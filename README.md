# Modal Popup Project ðŸ’¬

A simple modal popup built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Click a button to open a clean and animated modal window.

## ðŸ“š About This Project

This project started as a personal challenge to improve my frontend skills, especially in creating interactive UI components.  

While working on it, I briefly referred to a short tutorial to better understand how to handle a specific interaction, but the majority of the code and styling has been written and customized by me.  
The final result is a unique and polished modal component that reflects my growing experience with web development.

## âœ¨ Custom Features Added

- Custom CSS styling for the popup and animations  
- Personalized layout and color scheme  
- Extra touches to improve the user experience and interface responsiveness

These elements were not part of the original reference material and were added to make the project feel more complete and unique.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Button-triggered popup window  
- Smooth open/close animation  
- Responsive design  
- Clean and accessible layout
